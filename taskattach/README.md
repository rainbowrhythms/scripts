# taskattach.sh

This extends [taskattach](https://github.com/tzok/taskattach) with my personal workflow of taskwarrior + zk-org.

- Use fzf instead of selecting a specific file through annotation
- Add the concept of a "project". If a `zk` note exists in the project, create a symlink with the project note and all references.
